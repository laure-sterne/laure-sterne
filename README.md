- More about me 
`Multipurpose and curious, I learn quickly and I appreciate expanding my skills! 
Indeed, after a Bachelor's Degree in Publishing, I moved into the digital field in order to obtain plural skills 😁 
Thus, I wish to become a fullstack developer or mobile developer and ideally work in a company where I can be versatile and learn every day 🤩 `
