#### 🌱 I’m currently studying for being a software developer by learning a lot of programming languages like Go, PHP, Javascript, Python, jQuery, MySQL Server, etc.

#### 💛 More about me 
Multipurpose and curious, I learn quickly and I appreciate expanding my knowledge! 
Indeed, after a Bachelor's Degree in Publishing and a 3rd year in Digital Project Manager Bachelor, I moved into the developement because I like the creative side of this domain 😁 
Thus, I wish to become **a fullstack developer or mobile developer** and ideally work in a company where I can be versatile and learn every day 🤩
