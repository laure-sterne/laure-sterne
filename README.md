#### 👋 Hi, I’m @laure-sterne, a student learner at Ada Tech School since October 2022.
#### 👀 I’m interested in development, but python specifically!
#### 🌱 I’m currently studying for being a software developer by learning a lot of programming languages like Javascript, Python, jQuery, React, PHP, MySQL Server, Lua, etc.
#### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an apprenticeship from June 2022 until June 2023.

#### 💛 More about me 
Multipurpose and curious, I learn quickly and I appreciate expanding my skills! 
Indeed, after a Bachelor's Degree in Publishing and a 3rd year in Digital Project Manager Bachelor, I moved into the developement in order to obtain plural skills 😁 
Thus, I wish to become **a fullstack developer or mobile developer** and ideally work in a company where I can be versatile and learn every day 🤩
